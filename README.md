# Awise

#Introduction

After the covid pandemic, the number of interactions between people decreased significantly. As we are heading towards the end of the pandemic, people are returning to campus as the classes switched from online to in-person. It is true that the freshman and sophomore will have no hardships in finding roommates to live with as they live on campus and the roommates will be auto-assigned if he or she does not have a preference. But for the case of juniors and seniors and even grad students, it is hard to find roommates to live with as they have to know each other in order to find a roommate. Sharing the house with the roommate became more appealing as the rent price went through the roof. Sharing an apartment can not only lower the cost of the rent but also can act as a positive factor as sometimes students might be overwhelmed with the course work and need time off by speaking with their friends and in this case roommates. 

So our team “Awise” had come up with an idea to create a platform where users can put their roommate preferences. Just to give a brief introduction of the features that our product is aiming is first through user authentication, our platform can determine whether the student is actually enrolled in Emory or not. Then after this authentication process, there is a filter that users can input, for example, a personality test, a number of roommates, age, gender, amount of rent users are willing to pay and etc. After the process of screening, the user will be matched with another user based on the preference he or she had input. The metrics that our platform is going to use are if both users have more than 85% of the match. Based on the psychological study conducted, researchers claimed that there is a high possibility that two people will have a good relationship if he or she has a more than 75% of common grounds. 

To conclude, through our “Awise” platform, we will provide a service that decreases the amount of time spent on finding a roommate. It will not only decrease the effort in finding a roommate but at the same time, it will increase the likelihood for the users to find a roommate he or she likes. 

# Mission Statement
Awise is committed to bringing outstanding off-campus housing experience for Emory students by creating a platform to find perfect roommates through preference tests and other matching algorithms. 

# Vision Statement: 
A good life quality starts with having a comfortable home to live in.

# Elevator Pitch:
Awise will save time for students in the roommate searching process by having them 
post their information like preference and schedules, and the system will match the 
users with similar demands. We believe Awise can relief the pressure of finding roommates and reduce the searching time cost by one or two hours per day.

# Business Value:
This project fills the gap where off-campus students had difficulty in finding desired roommates. It will reduce the amount of time for Emory students who are willing to live off-campus spend on finding suitable roommates. It has the ability to save 11% of the time spent by students.

# Customers and Users:
The customer for this project is the junior, senior, and graduate students who are 
supposed to live off-campus. There are about 11,000 students of them at the Emory University.

# Metrics:
Number of successful matches
# successful matches / # all people using the service (proportion of successful matching)
Speed in which the app runs
Rating of students related to satisfaction of roommate assignment

# Milestones:
Assignment of team roles and the decision of techniques used (framework, technical components, etc.) by mid-September 
Demo software by late September
Primary features implemented (roommate matching) by late October
All features and functionalities will be implemented (user authentication) by early November 
Overall testing by late November 
Software Deployment by late November 

# Resources:
We need a server that can handle 11000 visitors a day (max). 
We need 7 developers to work part-time on this project for 3 month.
We need software frameworks that can support our demand of 11000 visitors a day.
We need a robust algorithm to match roommates (high precision) for different sizes of groups among a large variety of people.

# Risks:
Development takes longer than expected. 
Similar ideas being concurrently developed. 
Not all members are full-stack, so front end stories will go slower.
